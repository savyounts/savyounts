But let's start at the beginning...</p>\n<p>During college, I had one goal: to become a graphic designer. Graduation came, and BOOM, I achieved my goal. Within a year I became the Art Director at the company that I worked for, not too shabby for a 23-year-old. I was living the life I wanted and enjoyed what I was doing until I hit a wall. A creative wall. I didn't love graphic design anymore because I felt like the amount of creativity that I had was limited; I would only achieve so much in this position and I felt like I had just about achieved it. It slowly became something I wasn't passionate about because it wasn't something I felt that I could be great at, even if I knew all the programs I used through and through.</p>\n<p>After several months of feeling like this, I was trying to decide what direction to go with my career. What was something I felt I could be great at if I was willing to put in the time and hard work? I thought back to the single web design class my major had offered back in college and how interesting it had been and how much I had enjoyed it. It was exactly the sort of thing I thought I wanted, programming was the perfect mix of creativity and logic where I felt I could thrive. I thought more and more about it and had a few developer friends encourage me to take the leap, but then I started getting nervous. Thoughts about having to pay tuition WHILE also not having an income did not sit well with me. What if it didn't work out? What if people don't actually hire Bootcamp graduates? What if I was wrong and I didn't have what it took to be a programmer? I took a step back and decided to play it safe, I would first try out a completely different industry, join the corporate world and see how that goes.</p>\n<p>A few months later I started a job as a Partner Development Associate at a startup in Denver. It was a great company with great people and I was interested in what I was doing ... for about 2 or 3 months. Turns out cold-calling cleaning companies to see if they wanted to clean the houses we marketed wasn't really for me either (which, let's be real, I should have known that from the start). I was at a place where I counted the hours each day that slowly crept by and I knew that I needed another change.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, there were several occasions where I would overhear developer friends talking about the new Bootcamp graduates their companies had hired. I even met a few developers who had done Bootcamps themselves or were completely self-taught. Every time, I jumped into those conversations full of questions: what they liked, what they didn't like, was it a good decision, would they recommend it? I only ever got great feedback. After that, I immediately started my search to find out what schools I could go to if I could make this work financially, and if there was a way to find out if I'd really even enjoy this whole coding thing.</p>\n<p><em>Cue Flatiron School.</em></p>\n<p>Upon my google searches, I came across <a href=\"https://flatironschool.com/\">Flatiron School</a>. Not only did they have an online version of a Software Engineering Bootcamp, they also had a <a href=\"https://flatironschool.com/scholarships/\">Women Take Tech</a> Scholarship. With this scholarship, I would definitely be able to afford it! They also had a pretty intensive Bootcamp Prep Course that was <strong>free</strong>, I started immediately. I spent hours and hours on the Prep Course and didn't even mind; before work, after work, weekends, I was hooked. After a week or so of working through the course, I knew this was the right decision and the acceptance of the Women Take Tech Scholarship solidified it.</p>\n<p>I spent the next month or so wrapping everything up at my job so I could quit and do the course full-time. I'm currently on week three of my course and have loved every second (ok, almost every second) of it. I'm more motivated now to get up early to start and work later in the afternoon than I ever was for any job I've had. Whereas I have enjoyed it so far, I've definitely had a really tough day or two thrown in. Days where I've almost wanted to cry, like that <em>I-can't-get-this-last-test-I've-been-working-on-for-the-past-4-hours-to-pass</em> type of cry. But the thing is, I can step away, compose myself, and the next day when I come back to it, it works like magic.</p>\n<p>Coding can be hard, it can really get you down at times. But it's one of the \"jobs\" where I feel incredibly accomplished when I do figure it out and I think that's what keeps me coming back.</p>\n<p>So that's my story.. a bit long-winded and way more than you probably cared to know. This is just the beginning, but I think the ending is going to be well worth it!</p>"}
