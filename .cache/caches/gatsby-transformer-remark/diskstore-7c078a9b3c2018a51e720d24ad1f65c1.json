There are a few features I would eventually like to add to my project, so hope to come back after I finish up my program and add those in. For my next project, I'm certain I will again have all sorts of ideas of what I want my application to do. This time, I think I will make a numbered list to keep me organized, on-track, and a little more sane. My list will be what to focus on in what order, once I complete that task I will have the satisfaction of crossing it off and get to move to the next one. I know this sounds a bit silly and not super necessary, but I know once my mind gets going, it doesn't stop. Being able to write those ideas down and know that they will get accomplished ... just as soon as all of these other tasks get finished... I will be able to better focus on needs to be worked on at that moment.","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":1530},"end":{"line":22,"column":979,"offset":2508}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":1530},"end":{"line":22,"column":979,"offset":2508}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":23,"column":1,"offset":2509}}}}
