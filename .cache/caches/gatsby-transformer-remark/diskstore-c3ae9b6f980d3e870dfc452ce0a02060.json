I just completed my Sinatra web application, Route Finder, which was so incredibly easy and quick thanks to all of the Sinatra built-in features. Associations couldn't have been simpler to put together and everything flowed fairly easily. After getting all of my logic and functionality set up, the part that I spent the majority of my time on was the CSS to try to make my app look somewhat appealing.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":510,"offset":510},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":510,"offset":510},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"A bit about Route Finders:\nRoute finders is an app where a user can sign up and create an account where they can keep track of all of the climbing routes they are currently working on or have completed.

Thankfully, I learned from my last experience and did just that which proved to be so much better. For this project, I wasn't sure how much styling I was going to do for my site so once I formed my idea, I just focused on my backend logic and functionality. This was fine if I wanted to just have a simple black and white app, but this strategy made it more difficult when it did come time to add in my own CSS. Now I know that after I have my initial planning done, I should wireframe how I want my app to look as a final product. This way when I am building that initial logic and functionality, I can be thinking ahead of how things should be laid out, what should be grouped together in divs and what features will have a similar look so I can go ahead and give them appropriate class names.","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":1791},"end":{"line":14,"column":859,"offset":2658},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":1791},"end":{"line":14,"column":859,"offset":2658},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"On to bigger and better things!
