It does not enforce any rules on how it should be implemented, it is just a high-level design guideline to help improve consistency. In REST, the primary data representation is called a Resource. Resources should only have one logical URI that should provide a way to deliver the data that the client requests. It is best to name your resource and web page the same.</p>\n<p>A resource can be a single item or a collection of items.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>\"customers\"</code> is a collection resource that would use the URI <code>/customers</code></li>\n<li><code>customer</code> is a single resource that would use the URI <code>/customers/{customerId}</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A resource can also contain a sub-collection of resources</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If customers have accounts, you can reach all of a customer's  <code>accounts</code> using <code>/customers/{customerId}/accounts</code></li>\n<li>If you just want to see a single account of a customer you would use <code>/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>RESTful URI's should refer to a resource as a noun and not a verb.</p>\n<p>When connecting controller actions to views for CRUD functions in an application, it is best to follow this outline. Here I am using and example of a blogging app:</p>\n<p>CREATE :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>get '/blogs/new'</code> route will render an erb file that has a form where you can write a new blog. You may want to name this erb file <code>new.erb</code>.</li>\n<li>Once submitted, the form sents a <code>POST</code> request to another controller action, <code>post '/blogs'</code>. In this controller action, you will use the params hash and the <code>#create</code> method to create a new instance of a blog. It will also render an <code>index.erb</code> file where all of your blog posts will be shown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>READ:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To see all of the blog posts, you would create a controller, <code>get '/blogs'</code>. This should also render the <code>index.erb</code> file to show all of the blog instances.</li>\n<li>If you only want to see a specific blog, you can use the URI for a single item and have a controller <code>get '/blogs/:id</code>. Within the block of this controller you can set an instance variable equal to the blog that you want using the <code>#find</code> method with an argument of the blog id (<code>params[:id]</code>) on the Blog class. Then use that instance variable to display the blog and its contents in the <code>show.erb</code> view page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To update a blog, you would need to create a controller action that brings you to a new form where you can make edits.</li>\n<li>Use <code>get '/blogs/:id/edit'</code> to render an <code>edit.erb</code> view page with that form. Within the html <code>&#x3C;form></code> tag, you will need to set the <code>action=\"/blogs/&#x3C;%= @blog.id %>\"</code>. Make sure you are using erb tags to dynamically set the blog id. You will also need a hidden input field with a <code>name=\"_method\"</code> and <code>value=\"patch\"</code>. Also be sure to  include <code>use Rack::MethodOverride</code> in your <code>config.ru</code></li>\n<li>In your controller, set the instance variable of the blog using the <code>#find</code> method again.</li>\n<li>Once the form is submitted, it will send a <code>PATCH</code> request to <code>patch '/blogs/:id</code>. This controller action will find the instance of the model to update and save the instance. Then it will redirect to <code>'/blogs/#{blog.id}\"</code> to show the updated show page for that blog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DELETE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lastly, to delete a blog, you will need to have a delete button that is also shown on the <code>show.erb</code> view. This will be a form with a hidden input field like in the edit form, but with a <code>value=\"delete\"</code>.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have a submit button whose value is also <code>\"delete\"</code>.</li>\n<li>If the user is on a specific blog's show page and hits the button, it will send a <code>DELETE</code> request to <code>delete '/blogs/:id/delete'</code>. In this controller, you will find the instance using the id and then delete the instance.</li>\n</ul>"}
