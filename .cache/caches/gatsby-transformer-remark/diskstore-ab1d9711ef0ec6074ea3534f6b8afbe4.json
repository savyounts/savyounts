First off, I had a difficult time deciding the best way to implement the AJAX requests that I was required to have into the Rails app I had already built. Once I made a decision, I still ended up going back and changing how to do it several times.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":366,"offset":366}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":366,"offset":366}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the biggest struggles for me was figuring out how to get ahold of the information from all of the rails objects to be able to manipulate everything correctly in my JS. My index and show pages were mostly straight forward, the only information that I needed to bring over were the current user's Id and for the destination show page, also the destination Id. This was easily done by storing data attributes inside the html elements within the views. Once I got to POSTing comments with AJAX and then PATCHing with AJAX to update the amount of likes each comment had, that's when things started getting a bit more complicated.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":368},"end":{"line":4,"column":632,"offset":999}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":368},"end":{"line":4,"column":632,"offset":999}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Another issue I ran into  was trying to bind event handlers to elements that weren't currently present on a page.

So if I clicked \"My Destinations\", all my destinations would show up along with a button that said \"My Trips\". Since this new \"My Trips\" button is different from the previous one, it did not get that event handler bound to it.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":1001},"end":{"line":6,"column":608,"offset":1608}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":1001},"end":{"line":6,"column":608,"offset":1608}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To fix this, I needed to use a delegated handler.
