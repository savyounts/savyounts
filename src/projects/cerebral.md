Cerebral is a flashcard quiz game to help you study or challenge yourself to learn new things.
It was built with a Rails API backend to handle data storage and game logic and a React frontend that uses Redux for state management. It utilizes thunk middleware for asynchronous Redux actions to get/post data to/from the backend and uses a dynamic nested form to create decks containing many associated cards.
