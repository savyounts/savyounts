GOAT, or Get Out And Travel, allows you to search through destinations created by users to plan your next travel adventure! AJAX functionality is used to fetch and display different data based on user preference. I created a JavaScript front end with class based JS syntax.
User interface is designed with custom CSS and graphics.OAuth is used to provide users with Facebook login access.
