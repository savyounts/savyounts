I had so many ideas of everything I wanted my application to do and how it would work. And with the high I had from coming off my last two projects so quickly and easily, I felt that I could take on any challenge.</p>\n<p>That's where I was wrong.</p>\n<p>In the end, my app ended up doing about 90% of what I had originally intended for it to do, but it was much harder than I had hoped for. A big factor in this was that I wanted so much so quickly instead of being ok with just building a base and slowly building up new functionalities.</p>\n<p>The silver lining of was learning several valuable lessons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In CSS, no matter how you try to go about it, what sort of positioning you assign,  setting a percent from the left or the right, text-align everything in sight, or take a few moments to cry .. margin:auto only works if your object has display:block. This was a very small, but very big realization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't have two associations between the same two tables without a little extra work, but thankfully not too much extra work. <a href=\"http://savyounts.com/activerecord_aliases\">Aliases</a> are your friend and let you name your associations to things that just sound right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure omniAuth is spelled correctly or your third-party login will never work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't erase all of your working code when you refactor -- keep it close by in case this new, nice looking code breaks anything and everything.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start basic, then slowly add functionality.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All-in-all, I'm happy with how my project turned out. It had its rough moments, but they were all things I did to myself and (hopefully) am better for it. There are a few features I would eventually like to add to my project, so hope to come back after I finish up my program and add those in. For my next project, I'm certain I will again have all sorts of ideas of what I want my application to do. This time, I think I will make a numbered list to keep me organized, on-track, and a little more sane. My list will be what to focus on in what order, once I complete that task I will have the satisfaction of crossing it off and get to move to the next one. I know this sounds a bit silly and not super necessary, but I know once my mind gets going, it doesn't stop. Being able to write those ideas down and know that they will get accomplished ... just as soon as all of these other tasks get finished... I will be able to better focus on needs to be worked on at that moment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slow And Steady Wins The Race"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogs/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race/"}}}
