This was the first project I created completely from scratch and honestly, the hardest part was getting started.</p>\n<p>Typically in my labs, if no code is written, I at least have a repository and files all set up for me, my only job is to code. Not this time. Although I had read about all of these things in previous lessons; learning how to set up my own repository, getting all my files in line, and having a working environment, among other things, required a steep learning curve to be able to really understand and do on my own.</p>\n<p>Once I had a basic file that could run, ( but did no more than just print \"Welcome to Netflix Bestflix\") I was at least a little more in my comfort zone. Next, I had to figure out how I wanted this program to actually work. Avi and the Flatiron team gave great instructions on how to go step-by-step, plan it out, stub it out, slowly get each piece working. I read the ReadMes, watched the videos and immediately forgot everything and went straight to scraping.</p>\n<p><strong>--- ATTENTION :THIS IS A MISTAKE, DO NOT DO THIS---</strong></p>\n<p>After shooting myself in the foot because I skipped everything easy and went straight to the hard part. I stopped, took a breath, and backed up. I stubbed in the information I wanted, got that working and slowly built from there...just like they told me to. Sometimes you just have to do it wrong before it's ingrained in you how to do it right. So hopefully, I learned.</p>\n<p>Writing my initial code really wasn't too bad, I got stuck a few times and when I had a fresh pair of eyes look at it, I realized something was misspelled or I wasn't using a method I had clearly made to perform this particular action. Once everything was more-or-less working I was able to go back through and find all of the bugs -- things like making sure I can exit whenever I need to and that there aren't any situations where I would get stuck in a loop. After my initial debugging, I refactored my code a bit, which also helped my whole program to run a lot smoother.</p>\n<p>My biggest takeaways from this project were learning how to make something from nothing -- getting started with your repository, files, etc. --and to start from the beginning, don't jump into the coding and logic right away, make sure you have a clear idea of what you are trying to do and go step-by-step from there.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Netflix Bestflix -- A Ruby Gem"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogs/netflix-bestflix/"}}}
